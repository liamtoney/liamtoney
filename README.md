### Hello! 👋

🐻‍❄️ I am a PhD candidate studying seismology and infrasound at the
[University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF)](https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/).

🌋 At UAF, I am affiliated with the
[Geophysical Institute](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/)'s
[Alaska Volcano Observatory](https://avo.alaska.edu/) and
[Wilson Alaska Technical Center](https://watc.alaska.edu/).

⛰️ I also work part-time for the
[U.S. Geological Survey Geologic Hazards Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/geologic-hazards-science-center)
on science related to the
[Landslide Hazards Program](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/landslide-hazards)
mission.

🔈 In my free time, I like to
[make music with electronics](https://youtu.be/zhl-Cs1-sG4?t=110). I'm
inspired by the intersection of geophysical signals and audible sound — check
out [_sonify_](https://github.com/liamtoney/sonify) for one manifestation of this!
